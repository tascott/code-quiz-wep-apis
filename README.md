# Week 6 Challenge - Coding Quiz

## Description

This application takes some pre-written questions (and answers) and displays them one by one to the user. The timer starts at 60 seconds, the users final score is the amount of time left. Get the questions right to move on to the next one, get them wrong and 10 seconds is taken off the clock.


## Installation

Just clone or download the repository, and open index.html in your browser. No console viewing is required.

## Usage

Press the 'start quiz' button and the first question will appear, with four possible answers. Only one is correct. Press the right answer to move on. The time left (/score) is visible in the corner.

If you complete all the questions, the remaining time will be your score. Enter your initials to submit it to the leaderboard - you will be automatically redirected to the high scores page where you can view and erase the high scores (top 5 will be displayed).
